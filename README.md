# 500€-RTM-GUI

This is a graphical user interface developped for the 500€ RTM project. (http://500-euro-rtm.de/)
In its current state the GUI does not support the hardware but it comes with a simulator for testing.


## Setup
In order to run this GUI a few things are needed. 
- First, Python (https://www.python.org/) has to be installed. 
  This project was developped with Python 3.8.3 but may run on other versions.
- Second, Qt (version 5) (https://www.qt.io/ "Qt.io")  itself has to be installed.
  This is different on depending on the platform of choice. 
  Please refer to (https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/gettingstarted.html) for more information.

- Then clone this repo, change into its root directory and run
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- To start the GUI then run
  `python main.py`
  in the root directory.
